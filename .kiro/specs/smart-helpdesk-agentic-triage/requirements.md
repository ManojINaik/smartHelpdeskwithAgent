# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Smart Helpdesk with Agentic Triage is an end-to-end web application that revolutionizes customer support by combining human expertise with AI automation. The system allows users to raise support tickets that are automatically triaged by an AI agent, which classifies issues, retrieves relevant knowledge base articles, drafts responses, and either auto-resolves tickets or assigns them to human agents based on confidence thresholds. Built as a MERN stack application with Node.js orchestrating the agentic workflow, this system aims to reduce response times, improve consistency, and optimize support team efficiency.

8. WHEN triage workflow fails THEN the system SHALL assign ticket to human agent and log error details

### Requirement 5: Agent Review and Response

5. WHEN an agent sends a reply THEN the system SHALL update ticket status and notify the user
6. WHEN an agent reassigns a ticket THEN the system SHALL update assignee and log the action
7. WHEN an agent closes a ticket THEN the system SHALL mark it resolved and trigger user notification

### Requirement 6: System Configuration and Administration

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to configure AI agent behavior and system settings, so that I can optimize the balance between automation and human oversight based on our support team's needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria
