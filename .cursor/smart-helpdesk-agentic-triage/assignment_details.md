Smart Helpdesk with Agentic Triage Goal: Build an end‑to‑end web application where users raise support tickets and an AI coworker (agentic workflow) triages them by classifying, fetching relevant knowledge‑base (KB) articles, drafting a reply, and either auto‑resolving or assigning to a human. You may do this as MERN‑only (Node orchestrator).



User Stories Roles: ● End User: creates tickets, views status and agent replies. ● Support Agent: reviews triage, edits/drafts final reply, resolves tickets. ● Admin: manages KB articles; sets agent thresholds (confidence, auto‑close toggle). Core flows: 1. Auth & Roles: Sign up / sign in with JWT; role‑based access (Admin/Agent/User). 2. KB Management (Admin): CRUD articles (title, body, tags); publish/unpublish. 3. Ticket Lifecycle (User): Create ticket (title, description, category optional, attachments by URL). See timeline of actions. 4. Agentic Triage (System): On new ticket: ○ Classify category (billing / tech / shipping / other). ○ Retrieve top KB articles (keyword search minimum; embedding/vector optional). ○ Draft a suggested reply with citations to KB.

Compute a confidence score (0–1). If auto_close on and score ≥ threshold, auto‑reply & close; else assign to a human. ○ Log each step (trace id) to an Audit Log visible in UI. 5. Agent Review (Support Agent): Accept/edit draft, send reply, reopen/close ticket. 6. Notifications: Emit an in‑app notification and/or email stub on status change.





Stretch flows (pick any 1–2): ● Real‑time updates via WebSocket/Server‑Sent Events. ● SLA checks: mark breach if not responded in X hours; nightly job. ● Feedback loop: thumbs up/down on AI reply; retrainable prompts config. ● Attachments: extract simple text from .txt/.md URLs and include in triage.





MERN Only (Agent in Node) ● Frontend: React + Vite + (Context/Zustand/Redux), React Router. Tailwind optional. ● Backend: Node 20+ / Express + Mongoose (MongoDB Atlas/local). Background processing via in‑process queue or BullMQ (Redis) if you prefer. ● Agentic logic: Implement the workflow in Node. LLM calls  use the Gemini ai model use api key in .env



Data Model (suggested) User ● _id, name, email (unique), password_hash, role in {admin, agent, user}, createdAt. Article (KB) ● _id, title, body, tags: string[], status in {draft, published}, updatedAt. Ticket ● _id, title, description, category in {billing, tech, shipping, other}, status in {open, triaged, waiting_human, resolved, closed}, createdBy, assignee, agentSuggestionId?, createdAt, updatedAt. AgentSuggestion ● _id, ticketId, predictedCategory, articleIds: string[], draftReply, confidence: number, autoClosed: boolean, modelInfo (provider, model, promptVersion, latencyMs), createdAt. AuditLog ● _id, ticketId, traceId, actor in {system, agent, user}, action (e.g., TICKET_CREATED, AGENT_CLASSIFIED, KB_RETRIEVED, DRAFT_GENERATED, AUTO_CLOSED, ASSIGNED_TO_HUMAN, REPLY_SENT), meta (JSON), timestamp. Config ● _id, autoCloseEnabled: boolean, confidenceThreshold: number (0–1), slaHours: number.





API (minimum) Auth ● POST /api/auth/register → {token} ● POST /api/auth/login → {token} KB ● GET /api/kb?query=... (search title/body/tags) ● POST /api/kb (admin) ● PUT /api/kb/:id (admin) ● DELETE /api/kb/:id (admin) Tickets ● POST /api/tickets (user) ● GET /api/tickets (filter by status/my tickets) ● GET /api/tickets/:id ● POST /api/tickets/:id/reply (agent) → change status ● POST /api/tickets/:id/assign (admin/agent) Agent ● POST /api/agent/triage (internal) → enqueues triage for a ticket ● GET /api/agent/suggestion/:ticketId Config ● GET /api/config / PUT /api/config (admin) Audit ● GET /api/tickets/:id/audit You may add endpoints; keep them RESTful, versioned if you like (/api/v1). Use proper HTTP status codes.

The KB is just a collection of help articles stored in your own database (Article collection in MongoDB).

Each article has:

title

body

tags

status (draft/published)

Admins can CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) KB articles from inside your app.





Agentic Workflow (required steps) 1. Plan: Build a small planner that decides the steps given a ticket (classification → retrieval → drafting → decision). Hardcode the plan or encode as a simple state machine. 2. Classify: Use a prompt or rule‑based keywords (deterministic stub allowed). Output schema: { "predictedCategory": "billing|tech|shipping|other", "confidence": 0.0 } 3. Retrieve KB: At least keyword search (simple regex/BM25/TF‑IDF). Return top 3 article IDs with snippet scores. 4. Draft Reply: Compose a short answer with numbered references to the selected KB articles. Output schema: { "draftReply": "...", "citations": ["", ""] } 5. Decision: If autoCloseEnabled and confidence ≥ threshold → store suggestion, create agent reply, mark ticket resolved, log AUTO_CLOSED. Else mark waiting_human and assign to a human. 6. Logging: Every step must append an AuditLog event with a traceId (UUID) consistent across the pipeline. Deterministic LLM Stub (must include): ● Implement LLMProvider with an interface classify(text), draft(text, articles). ● Provide a STUB_MODE=true env so we can run without keys. The stub should: ○ Classify by simple heuristics (words: “refund/invoice”→billing, “error/bug/stack”→tech, “delivery/shipment”→shipping, else other) and generate a pseudo confidence based on keyword matches. ○ Draft a templated reply inserting KB titles.



Frontend Requirements ● Pages: Login/Register; KB List+Editor (admin only); Ticket List; Ticket Detail (conversation thread + agent suggestion + audit timeline); Settings (config). ● State: Keep auth token securely; show role‑based menus. ● UX: Clear CTAs; loading skeletons; error toasts; form validation; responsive layout. ● Nice to have: Search & filters; optimistic updates; accessible components (keyboard nav, ARIA labels). Security & Reliability ● Don’t log secrets. Never return stack traces to clients. ● Input validation (e.g., Zod/Joi) on all POST/PUT. ● JWT with expiry & refresh or short‑lived access + refresh. ● Rate limit auth & mutation endpoints. CORS configured narrowly. ● Timeouts for agent calls; retry with backoff; idempotency key for triage jobs. Observability ● Structured logs (JSON) with traceId & ticketId where relevant. ● Basic request logging middleware (method, path, latency, status). ● Expose /healthz and /readyz. DevOps (minimum viable) ● Docker Compose with services: client, api, mongo, (agent, redis if Track B or BullMQ). ● One‑command run: docker compose up. ● Seed script to insert sample users, KB articles, and tickets. Testing ● Backend: At least 5 tests (Jest/Vitest) covering: auth, KB search, ticket create, agent triage decision, audit logging. ● Frontend: At least 3 tests (Vitest/RTL) for rendering + form validation. ● Fixtures: Provide JSON fixtures for stubbed LLM outputs and seed data. ● Postman/Thunder tests (optional): Include a collection. Acceptance Criteria (we will verify) 1. Can register/login and create a ticket as a normal user. 2. Creating a ticket triggers triage; an AgentSuggestion is persisted. 3. If confidence ≥ threshold and auto‑close is on, ticket is moved to resolved with agent reply appended; user sees the reply. 4. If below threshold, ticket becomes waiting_human; an agent can open the ticket, review the draft, edit, and send. 5. Audit timeline shows ordered steps with timestamps and traceId. 6. KB search returns relevant articles for simple queries. 7. App runs with STUB_MODE=true and no external keys. 8. docker compose up brings the stack up; clear README with envs and seed steps.

Hints & Gotchas ● Keep prompts and stub rules versioned; include promptVersion in modelInfo. ● Avoid leaky abstractions: separate agent from kb and tickets services. ● Immutability for audit events; don’t rewrite history. ● Be explicit about timezones, ISO timestamps.
